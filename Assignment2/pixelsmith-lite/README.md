# PixelSmith Lite — tiny pixel editor (React + TS)

A super small demo to showcase GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
Features: 16–64 grid, brush & eraser, color picker, drag to paint, clear, export PNG.
No tests, no undo/redo, no flood-fill — intentionally tiny.

## Quickstart
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
